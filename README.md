INTRODUCTION

This project is an exploratory analysis of foodborne illness outbreaks in the US and what foods are associated with them. These patterns will be broken down at the state level, and Tennessee specifically will be compared to other states and the nation as a whole. Outbreaks will also be examined by food categories to show which types of foods are more commonly associated with these illnesses. Time periods during which more people are staying inside, such as during COVID, will also be examined to quantify changes in trends of these outbreaks. 

ANALYSIS

Data was obtained from various sources (located under Data Sources), and some of these data were transformed using jupyter notebook; these jupyter scripts are located in the 'scripts' folder. Data was then exported as csv files and then imported to tableau to create dashboards. 

PRESENTATION

The following data questions are explored in the Tableau presentation:
- What are the general trends of foodborne illness over time in the US?
- What is the general trend of foodborne illness in TN? How is this different from other states or the US as a whole?
- What foodborne illness are associated with what foods? Are there certain food categories that are more commonly associated with foodborne illness than others?
- What organisms are most commonly associated with foodborne illness? 
- How did COVID affect trends in foodborne illness? Is there a correlation between lockdown stringency and foodborne illness transmission?
